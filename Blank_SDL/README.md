# Blank SDL Beginning Code
### Nikki Kyllonen

These files can be compiled using the Makefile and run from the executable `proj` placed in the `build/bin/` directory. When run, the code generates a blank SDL window with a sky blue background. Although no models are displayed, a cube and a sphere model are loaded from the `models` directory as well as two textures and two shaders from their respective `textures` and `Shaders` directories.
